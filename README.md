Elona+ Custom-G-S

This mod strives to extend the Custom-G, which in turn extends Elona+ Custom, which in turn extends Elona+. It's a lot, I know.

Planned features:
* Remove sleep requirement for pets. Hopefully I'll replace it with a 24h cooldown, but we'll see.
* Rescale platinum gain from repeatable quests.
* Make gardening scale just a bit higher so your high levels aren't as wasted.
* Make seed rewards from Harvest quests scale a bit higher. (Overshoot the requirement by more than 3 times!)
